# xelt

This is a fork of [Gediminas Morkevicius](https://github.com/l3pp4rd/st) terminal client.


## Requirements

In order to build st you need:

- Xlib header files - location of these might differ, edit config.mk
- xft lib headers.
- Inconsolata.ttf fonts, unless you change it in config.h


### Ubuntu required libraries

## Build instructions

**NOTE** concerning [inconsolata font
changes](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=206805), recently it
got bold font support and if you had hinstyle set to **none** it should
not make any impact. Otherwise you may need to set it to none.
